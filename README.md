# Satoshi Tribute

## TL;DR

To mine **$SATOSHI** coins, send **0.06 TON** with the text **`F`** to the contract address:

`EQCkdx5PSWjj-Bt0X-DRCfNev6ra1NVv9qqcu-W2-SaToSHI`

You can do this:

* Manually from your any TON wallet
* Via the [web interface](https://chiliec.github.io/Satoshi/)
* Or using the [automatic mining script](https://github.com/chiliec/satoshi-sender)

---

## Introduction

**Satoshi Tribute** is a decentralized token created to honor **Satoshi Nakamoto**, the visionary behind blockchain technology.

This project is a tribute to his revolutionary ideas that reshaped global finance, fostering a community built on **decentralization, fairness, and innovation**.

---

## Mining

Mining **$SATOSHI** is simple and fair:

* Send **0.06 TON** to the contract address with the text **`F`** to attempt mining.
* The probability of success **increases with time since the last block** and **decreases with repeated attempts**.
* There are **no extra fees, pre-mining, or hidden mechanisms**â€”everyone has the same opportunity.
* Rewards follow Bitcoinâ€™s logic: halved every **210,000 blocks (\~4 years)**.

Mining probability is defined by the open-source algorithm below:

## Smart Contract Transparency

* Built on **proven TON blockchain technology**.
* The mining probability algorithm is **fully open-source**.
* Full implementation is available in [`Probability.tact`](contracts/traits/Probability.tact).

This ensures **complete transparency and security**.
